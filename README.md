# Linear-Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous numerical values based on input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

Types:
1. Simple linear regression: Uses one independent variable.
2. Multiple linear regression: Uses two or more independent variables.

Applications: Widely used for tasks like:
1. Forecasting: Predicting future values based on historical data (e.g., sales forecasting)
2. Trend analysis: Identifying trends in data over time
3. Correlation exploration: Understanding the relationship between variables

Limitations:
1. Assumes a linear relationship between features and target variable. Not suitable for non-linear relationships.
2. Sensitive to outliers in the data.


Overall, linear regression is a fundamental and versatile algorithm in machine learning, offering a simple and interpretable approach to prediction and analysis.
